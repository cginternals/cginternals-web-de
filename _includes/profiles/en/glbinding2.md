##### glbinding

[glbinding](https://github.com/cginternals/glbinding) is a full-fledged, MIT licensed, cross-platform C++ binding for the OpenGL API. Based on the OpenGL API specification, ranging from 1.0 to the latest 4.5, glbinding is generated using scripts and templates that can be adapted to fit custom needs. It leverages modern C++11 features like enum classes, lambdas, and variadic templates, instead of relying on macros (e.g., compared to GLEW). It features type-safe parameters, per feature API headers, lazy function resolution, multi-context and multi-thread support, global and local function callbacks, as well as tools and examples for quick-starting your projects. The command line tools provide insights into your system, with respect to OpenGL capabilities (similar to GL Extension Viewer), a drivers [context creation behavior](https://github.com/cginternals/glbinding/wiki/Context-Creation-Cheat-Sheet) or its default OpenGL state.
