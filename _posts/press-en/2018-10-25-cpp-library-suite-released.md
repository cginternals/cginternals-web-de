[CG Internals](https://www.cginternals.com/en/) released four of their projects: [cpplocate](https://www.cpplocate.org), [cppassist](https://www.cppassist.org), [cppfs](https://www.cppfilesystem.org), and [cppexpose](https://www.cppexpose.org).
Together, these projects consolidate and provide domain-agnostic features for C++. Most prominent features are run-time assets location, command-line argument parsing, logging, STL extensions, multi-threading and vectorization helpers, cross-platform file-system access, object reflection, scripting, and a plugin system.

All sources are published using an MIT-compatible license and are provided as installers for Windows and *.deb* packages within the [cginternals PPA](https://launchpad.net/~cginternals/+archive/ubuntu/ppa).
