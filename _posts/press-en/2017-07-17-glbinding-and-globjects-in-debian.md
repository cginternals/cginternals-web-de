Both glbinding and globjects in their latest stable release are available in Debian 9 "stretch" in the default package repositories.
We gratefully acknowledge the work of the Debian mentors team and Ghislain Antony Vaillant in particular for their work to integrate our libraries for widespread use.
Following the release in Debian, more downstream distributions are likely to adopt our libraries for their default package repositories.
This has happened with Ubuntu as of 17.10.
